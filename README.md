# Troutopia Webcomic Management System

**Version Alpha**

Troutopia is a simple webcomic backend for any creator, but mostly for, me, John S. Troutman. It allows users to avoid large installations of other CMS platforms and also gives users more control over their website's code.

Troutopia is fairly no-frills and does absolutely no web design for you; all it does is run the webcomic archive with some simple hooks. Said hooks are one line bits of text you can drop into any section of your website.

I taught myself PHP in the process of coding this, so things may or may not work correctly. Feel free to shoot any questions about Troutopia to me on Twitter via @theonlytrout or through e-mail via troutcave@gmail.com. You could also do me a favor and read my comics at troutcave.net.
